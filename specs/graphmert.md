Excellent question. This is where we move from the theoretical "what" to the practical "how." Designing a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) is the first step in building a real system. Given your background, we can absolutely architect a robust, modern solution primarily using the .NET ecosystem, while strategically incorporating the best tools for the AI-specific tasks.

You've hit on the key debate: monolithic language choice vs. polyglot microservices. The modern answer is almost always the latter: **use the right tool for the right job.**

Here is a TRD for the "GraphMERT Factory" that leverages your expertise in C#/.NET while embracing Rust and Python for their specific strengths.

### **Technical Requirements Document (TRD): Project NeuroSymbolic Factory**

**1. Vision & Mission**

*   **Vision:** To create a scalable, automated factory for producing and hosting domain-specific neurosymbolic AI experts.
*   **Mission:** To build a microservices-based platform that can ingest raw text corpora, orchestrate the training and distillation of reliable Knowledge Graphs (KGs) using the GraphMERT pipeline, and expose these KGs as queryable, high-performance APIs.

**2. System Architecture Overview**

The system will be a cloud-native, event-driven architecture composed of decoupled microservices. The core philosophy is a ".NET Sea" for robust business logic and services, with a "Python/Rust Island" for specialized, high-performance AI computation.

**3. Component Breakdown & Technology Choices**

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each service and the recommended tech stack, explaining the rationale.

| Component | Technology | Rationale & Your Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Ingestion & MoE APIs** | **C# / ASP.NET Core 10** | This is the front door. ASP.NET Core is extremely fast, mature, and perfect for building high-throughput, secure REST or gRPC APIs. Your .NET 8/10 experience makes this the ideal choice. It's more than capable of handling production loads, competing directly with Go in many benchmarks. |
| **Orchestration Service** | **C# / .NET 10 with MassTransit or Azure Durable Functions** | This is the brain of the factory. It manages the long-running workflows (ingest -> preprocess -> train -> index). An event-driven approach is best. **MassTransit** is a powerful open-source framework for building message-based applications, while **Durable Functions** is a great serverless option if you're in Azure. Your C# skills are perfect here. |
| **GraphMERT Training Core** | **Python 3.11+ (in a Docker Container)** | This is non-negotiable. The AI ecosystem (PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers) lives in Python. We will not rewrite it. Instead, we'll containerize the entire Python training script. The .NET Orchestrator's job is simply to trigger this container as a job (e.g., a Kubernetes Job) with the right configuration. **This is the key to bridging the .NET and Python worlds.** |
| **Knowledge Graph (KG) Store** | **Neo4j or Azure Cosmos DB for Gremlin** | A specialized graph database is required to efficiently store and query the KG. Neo4j is the industry standard with excellent tooling. The .NET client library for it (`Neo4j.Driver`) is mature and robust. |
| **Inference Service (Optional but Recommended)** | **Rust with Actix Web + ONNX Runtime** | **This is where Rust shines.** While the initial GRAPHMERT model is for extraction, you might want a live API endpoint for other neural tasks. For a memory-safe, blisteringly fast, low-overhead API that just serves model inferences, Rust is the undisputed champion. It prevents entire classes of bugs and has minimal overhead. This would be a self-contained microservice, a great place to learn Rust without disrupting the core .NET logic. |

**Your question on Go vs. Rust vs. .NET:**

*   **Why not Go?** Go is fantastic for high-concurrency network services. However, modern **ASP.NET Core is so performant** that the benefit of introducing a second language (and ecosystem) for the API layer is minimal compared to the cost of maintaining it. Sticking with .NET for the service layer leverages your team's existing skills for 95% of the performance at 50% of the cognitive overhead.
*   **Why Rust?** Rust is for when every nanosecond and every byte of memory counts, and correctness is paramount (no nulls, no data races). The AI inference service is the one place where this level of optimization provides a clear, measurable benefit that justifies using a different language. It is the "special forces" tool for the most critical performance bottleneck.

**4. Key Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

*   **Scalability:** The architecture must scale horizontally. Training jobs should be containerized and run in parallel on a container orchestrator like Kubernetes (AKS/EKS).
*   **Reliability:** Use message queues for durable, asynchronous communication between services. If the Indexing Service goes down, the messages will wait safely in the queue.
*   **Configurability:** Each "expert" will require a different dataset, seed KG, and hyperparameters. These will be managed as configuration files (e.g., YAML) and passed to the training jobs.
*   **Observability:** Implement structured logging (e.g., with Serilog), metrics (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry), and tracing across all services to diagnose issues in the distributed system.

**5. Factory Workflow (Data Flow)**

1.  **Initiation:** A user hits the Ingestion API with a raw text corpus (e.g., a zip file of PubMed abstracts) and a configuration file defining the domain.
2.  **Queuing:** The API publishes a `TrainingJobRequested` event to the message queue.
3.  **Orchestration:** The Orchestration Service consumes the event, calls the Preprocessing Service to clean the data, and stores the result in blob storage.
4.  **Distillation:** The Orchestrator then launches the containerized Python **GraphMERT Training Core**, pointing it to the preprocessed data and config. This is a long-running, asynchronous job.
5.  **Indexing:** Upon successful completion, the training core saves the KG (e.g., as JSON) to blob storage and signals the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator then calls the **KG Indexing Service**, which reads the KG file and loads it into the Neo4j database.
6.  **Activation:** The expert is now "live" and can be queried via the **Expert MoE API**.
